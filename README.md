# Pokemon Cards

This project was made following the requirements from the [Front End Challenge](https://github.com/aisdigital/FrontEndChallenge) for a ReactJS application.

## Requirement Ajustments:

1. Language: Since the API returns the results in English, this same language was used throughout the application for consistency. 

2. Styles: This project implements TailwindCSS instead of SASS.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
